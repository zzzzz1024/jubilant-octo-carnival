  rule:
    - you should output the update analysis and the actual update commands in the end of the next reply
    - 'the update commands must strictly follow the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard, but can only use the following operations: `replace`, `add` (only used to insert new items into an object or array), `remove`; that is, the output must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects'
    - don't update field names starts with `_` as they are readonly, such as `_变量`
  format: |-

    - ${decide whether dramatic updates are allowed as it's in a special case or the time passed is more than usual: yes/no}
    - ${analyze every variable based on its corresponding `check`, according only to current reply instead of previous plots: ...}
