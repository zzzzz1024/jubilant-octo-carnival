变量输出格式:
  rule:
    - you must output the update analysis and the actual update commands at once in the end of the next reply
    - the update commands works like the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard, must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects, but supports the following operations instead:
      - replace: replace the value of existing paths
      - delta: update the value of existing number paths by a delta value
      - insert: insert new items into an object or array
      - remove
    - don't update field names starts with `_` as they are readonly, such as `_变量`

    - ${calculate time passed: ...}
    - ${decide whether dramatic updates are allowed as it's in a special case or the time passed is more than usual: yes/no}
    - ${analyze every variable based on its corresponding `check`, according only to current reply instead of previous plots: ...}
