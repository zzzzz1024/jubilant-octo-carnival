  rule:
    - you must output the update analysis and the actual update commands in the end of the next reply
    - 'the update commands must strictly follow the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard, but can only use the following operations: `replace` (replace the value of existing paths), `add` (insert new items into an object or array, "value" should be the result value instead of the delta value), `remove`; that is, the output must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects'
    - don't update field names starts with `_` as they are readonly, such as `_变量`
